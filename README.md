This is my BCS350 Web Database Development Capstone Project. 
This project shows that I have fully understood how to utilize PhP for authentication, validation, session and cookie management, as well as connecting a MySQL database with full CRUD functionality to the website.
This website is a medical appointment booking website that is inspired by real life services such as Zocdoc.
