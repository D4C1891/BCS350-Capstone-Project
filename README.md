This project is my BCS350 Web Database Development Capstone Project and demonstrates my understanding of building database-driven web applications using PHP, JavaScript, and MySQL. The application implements secure user authentication, strong password handling, client-side and server-side validation, session and cookie management, and full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality.

The project is a medical appointment booking website inspired by real-world platforms such as Zocdoc, allowing users to register accounts, log in securely, and book, update, cancel, and view medical appointments. All data is stored and managed through a MySQL database using prepared statements to ensure data integrity and security.

This project reflects my ability to design, implement, and secure a complete web-based database application.
